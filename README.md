# MUBI-Analytics-Project
Crunching Movie Data with MUBI API, SQLite &amp; Python

## What is MUBI?

- MUBI could be described as the "Netflix for art movies".

- If you don't know it yet, have a look at this beautiful SVOD platform: https://mubi.com/. You could get a 30-day free trial !

- Formerly known as The Auteurs, MUBI was founded in 2007 by Efe Ã‡akarel who wanted to create a social network for cinema lovers.

- MUBI users have a selection of thirty movies on a daily rotating basis. Unlike many SVOD platforms relying on recommendation systems, the MUBI selection is human-curated.

- On May 21st, MUBI opened its cinema library to extend this curated selection.

- Over time, MUBI has become a distributor as well as a producer.
